<font size="3">**"QuadFi is fundamentally revolutionizing how risk is viewed and assessed in the modern era," (CEO Nikjoo).**

###  <font color="blue">_1.1. <a name='Nameofcompany_font'></a> Name of company_</font>

Quadfi is a Toronto-based online lender that specializes in providing underserved credit groups, including new immigrants and international students, with fair and affordable loans. 


### <font color="blue">_1.2. <a name='WhoarethefoundersofthecompanyWhenwasthecompanyincorporated_font'></a> Who are the founders of the company? When was the company incorporated?_</font>
The fintech startup prides itself in being a company founded by immigrants for immigrants. The online lending platform was founded in 2018 by CEO Dr. Manny Nikjoo (Ph.D.) and COO Mehdi Ghaffari.


###  <font color="blue">_1.3. <a name='Howdidtheideaforthecompanyorprojectcomeaboutfont_'></a> How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? </font>_

The standardized FICO credit score created over three decades ago is obsolete today. It uses irrelevant data and ostracizes lower-income groups and newcomers without any credit history, even though they would be deemed perfectly suitable borrowers using another data set. The most widely used option for these groups looking to get a quick loan is shark lenders, which charge exorbitant interest rates. To create a fair and inclusive credit environment, the founders of Quadfi developed an innovative platform that identifies what it refers to as "prime and super-prime customers through advanced modeling and alternative data, including academic achievements, income levels, and open banking information. The FinTech startup uses a proprietary process to convert and integrate credit information from overseas to North American standards" (Mandel, 2022).


###  <font color="blue">_1.4. <a name='HowisthecompanyfundedHowmuchfundinghavetheyreceivedfont_'></a>How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?</font>_
In April 2022, the startup raised _<font color="yellow">CAD $127 Million in debt financing.</font>_ The funds were raised by Crayhill Capital Management, a New York-based alternative asset management firm (Crunchbase). With this investment, the company intends to extend product offerings beyond credit and build a solid  foundation to support newcomers' lives. The exact information on their product expansion hasn't been disclosed yet.

###  <font color="blue">_2.1. <a name='Whatspecificfinancialproblemisthecompanyorprojecttryingtosolve_font'></a> What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?_</font>

In 1989, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) established a standardized way to regulate creditworthiness – the proprietary FICO score. Before that, creditworthiness was assessed by loan officers who made biased opinions about borrowers without any quantitative analysis. The FICO credit score as we know it today was meant to be equitable since everyone would be judged on the same criteria. The application processor at the loan office doesn't have to like you anymore; the data will speak for itself.
However, three decades later, the reality of this standardized approach is quite different. _<font color="yellow">What was meant to be an equitable system has become a dismembered and vague data field using undisclosed information that we're unaware of and, thus, can't change.</font>_ You are categorized as "bad, poor, fair, good, or excellent" based on criteria chosen over three decades ago. All we know from FICO is the following: 

• **35% is payment history.**

• **30% is debt burden.**

• **15% is credit history length.**

• **10% is the type of credit you have.**

• **10% is recent searches on your credit.**

 
<font color= "yellow"> *"Credit scoring has a very limited view of people's overall financial health, purchasing power, and payment histories"* </font> (Fishman, 2021). The most striking example of this statement is that a FICO credit score doesn't consider regular rent payments in its calculations. Not taking into account on-time payments of rent, utilities, and cellphones puts the burden on the lower class and newcomers who don't have a mortgage or car loans to boost their credit. 
Another example of the unfair evaluation of credit scoring on the working class is the absence of consideration of the length of employment. Someone who filed for bankruptcy during the economic downturn of 2008 most likely still has a poor credit score today, even though the bankrupt has kept a stable job over the last decade. Although, "length of employment is actually one of the best indicators of a borrower's creditworthiness" (Fishman, 2021).
<font color= "yellow"> *Not only the relevant data that is most informative for evaluating a borrower is excluded, but the data used is undisclosed, and thus, people can't influence it* </font> (Fishman, 2021). This is where fintech companies like QuadFi come into play. They revolutionize standardized consumer lending by including players previously ostracized, like new immigrants and low-income families, by including new and relevant data in their creditworthiness evaluations. 


###  <font color="blue">_2.2. <a name='WhoisthecompanysintendedcustomerIsthereanyinformationaboutthemarketsizeofthissetofcustomers_font'></a>Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?_</font>

QuadFi aims to provide loans to newcomers in Canada without any credit history. QuadFi is the only FinTech startup to provide these services. As a result, their potential demand encompasses all 400,000 new immigrants arriving every year in the country. In 2022, the government admitted 431,645 new permanent residents – the highest amount in Canadian history. "In the 2023–2025 Immigration Levels Plan, Canada aims to welcome from 410,000 to 505,000 new permanent residents in 2023, from 430,000 to 542,000 in 2024, and 442,500 to 550,000 in 2025" (Government of Canada).


###  <font color="blue">_2.3. <a name='WhatsolutiondoesthiscompanyofferthattheircompetitorsdonotorcannotofferWhatistheunfairadvantagetheyutilize_font'></a>What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)_</font>

The Fintech startup <font color="yellow">_offers a personal loan of up to $50,000 to newcomers, which can be approved within minutes.</font>_ This loan can be used for about anything from paying other high-interest debt to student loans. The CEO, Nikjoo states that they have a _<font color="yellow">unique first-mover advantage in the Canadian market</font>_ since no other fintech startup does the same. QuadFi uses an innovative, forward approach to approve its clients' creditworthiness. Since clients don't have any data background in Canada, the model identifies what it refers to as _<font color="yellow">"prime and super-prime customers through advanced modeling and alternative data, including academic achievements, income levels, and open banking information.</font>_ The FinTech startup uses a proprietary process to convert and integrate credit information from overseas to North American standards" (Mandel, 2022).

The direct competition of QuadFi represents the other lending sources available to newcomers in Canada. However, these options are either very expensive or limited since these newcomers don't have any financial history in North America.
The first option available is to obtain a loan through the Canadian government for up to $10,000, but the paperwork process is lengthy. In addition, the charity Windmill Microlending also provides loans to newcomers, but only for up to $15,000. Unfortunately, the third and most common option is to go through shark lenders, who charge ridiculously high-interest rates with the advantage of not requiring any credit history. Lastly, the BDC (Business Development Bank of Canada) is the most attractive substitute, with loans between $25,000 to $50,000 for immigrants. However, the downside is that it can only be used for business purposes and charges a higher interest rate. <font color="yellow">_At QuadFi, borrowers pay rates starting at 5.99% without any hidden fees or early payment penalties.</font>_ In comparison, the average personal loan rate is 9.05%, according to Statistics Canada (Horwood & Escobal, 2023).

(This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)_ </font></font>

The company's platform uses _<font color="yellow">"machine learning, artificial intelligence, alternative underwriting data, and granular academic data"_ </font>(Pitchbook).
Nikjoo states that "what we are doing is a _<font color="yellow">_paradigm shift: we are changing the underwriting focus from historical data to a forward-looking approach" </font>_(Mandel, 2022). This is part of QuadFi's forward approach to assessing creditworthiness. Instead of looking at historical data in Canada (which is inexistent for newcomers), they take relevant information from their home countries, such as education and income level. Then they use a "proprietary process to convert and integrate credit information from overseas to North American standards" (Mandel, 2022). As a result, they can identify "good" borrowers years before they can even obtain a fair credit score in Canada.

###  <font color="blue">_3.1. <a name='Whatdomainofthefinancialindustryisthecompanyin_fontfont'></a>What domain of the financial industry is the company in?_ </font></font>

QuadFi is part of the _<font color="yellow">fintech consumer lending market.</font>_ "The Global Fintech Lending Market Size was valued at USD 1,385.66 billion in 2022" (Spherical Insights) 



###  <font color="blue">_3.2. <a name='Whathavebeenthemajortrendsandinnovationsofthisdomainoverthelast5-10yearsfont_font'></a>What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?</font>_</font>

1.	Nowadays, with people opting to rent over buying property – especially the younger generation, it is essential to account for "good" renters. Fintech innovates with technologies to <font color="yellow"> _report recurring, on-time payments directly to the credit bureaus from the customer's bank account._ </font>
    
 2.	How we earn money has changed drastically over the last decade; Fintech solutions can now <font color="yellow"> _integrate payroll apps and other sources of income like cryptocurrency. </font>_

 3.	In an ever-changing world, the criteria used in credit assessment must evolve. That's why Fintech lending adds payroll data obtained by APIs, which <font color="yellow"> _includes more relevant financial information, like the length of employment. </font>_

 4.	In an increasingly interconnected world, accounting for international sources of income is essential. Similarly to our company QuadFi, others <font color="yellow"> _use international sources of income to assess creditworthiness.</font>_
 5.	When everything from bank account transactions to paying utilities is done instantly, why would a credit score be updated once per month? And why would our financial situation from a decade ago bias it? That's the problem that fintech is solving to <font color="yellow">_"paint a better real-time picture to give potential creditors an understanding of what's happening now and in the last few years" </font>_(Mendel, 2022).
 

###  <font color="blue">_3.3. <a name='Whataretheothermajorcompaniesinthisdomainfont_'></a>What are the other major companies in this domain?   </font>_
Domain of Customer Lending:

<font color="yellow">***Stilt***

    The US-based company offers personal loans without a US credit history to immigrants, including international students and working professionals. To do so, they assemble a credit report with nontraditional credit accounts like rent, utility, or life insurance. They translate foreign credit history to US standards and obtain written verification from foreign creditors. JG Wentworth acquired the bank, and evidence of its success is that 40% of loan revenues come from returning customers.

***Experian Boost***

    Experian Boost has improved the consumer credit scores of over 9 million people. The technology uses positive payment history like rent, utilities, and cellphone bills by connecting this data to bank and credit card accounts. On top of it, this service is 100% free.

***Affirm***

    Affirm offers short-term instant loans for online retail with rates ranging from 0% to 30%. When shopping online, Affirm processes the order at checkout, settling the total amount to the store, and services the loan directly with the customer.

***AVANT***

    AVANT is another online lending platform for more significant amounts, thus at higher rates. With this platform, customers can borrow instantly from $1000 to $35,000 at a rate ranging from 10% to 36% over the span of 2-5 years. The company is a success; it has lent $2 billion already and received $659 million in funding.

***Credit Karma*** </font>

    Founded during the 2008 recession, the company offers free credit scores and credit monitoring to help people improve their creditworthiness. The company is valued at $3.5 billion.

###  <font color="blue">_4.1. <a name='Whathasbeenthebusinessimpactofthiscompanysofar_font'></a> What has been the business impact of this company so far?_</font>

Driven by QuadFi's ability to provide more accurate credit ratings using advanced modeling and alternative data, the company has seen <font color="yellow">_"month-over-month growth of over 500% in its credit portfolio"_ </font>(Cision, 2022).
The next step for the cutting-edge Fintech lender is to broaden product offerings to not only credit but a solid foundation of a full range of financial products designed by immigrants _for_ immigrants. This is a step toward QuadFi's <font color="yellow">_goal of becoming "the first global financial institution serving immigrants</font>_, no matter where they came from or when they arrived in their new country" (Cision, 2022).



###  <font color="blue">_4.2. <a name='WhataresomeofthecoremetricsthatcompaniesinthisdomainusetomeasuresuccessHowisyourcompanyperformingbasedonthesemetrics_font'></a> What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?_</font>

Beyond generating extrinsic value, Quadfi aims to add intrinsic value by <font color="yellow">_leveraging its technical and engineering expertise to improve the lives of newcomers_</font>. Their "B" rating assesses their positive social impact on society as a _<font color="yellow">Certified B Corporation. The "B" stands for "benefit for all."</font>_ "For a company to become a Certified B Corporation, signatories must demonstrate they are purpose-driven and create benefits for broader society. Certification is backed by an independent, rigorous, and ongoing assessment process" (Mandel, 2022).
In terms of a quantitative measure of their success, we can consider the default rate on their loans based on their alternative credit assessment. There's no accurate information on that matter, but CEO Nikjoo states that _<font color="yellow">Quadfi's default rate is "extremely low and under the firm's target" </font>_(Mandel, 2022).


###  <font color="blue">_4.3. <a name='Howisyourcompanyperformingrelativetocompetitorsinthesamedomainfont_'></a>How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?</font>_

QuadFI has generated staggering growth as the _<font color="yellow">first-mover in fintech lending in Canada</font>_, with a _<font color="yellow">_500% month-over-month credit portfolio growth._</font>_ As for comparison, in 2022, QuadFi's most prominent competitor – Stilt – raised $114M in Series A funding in debt and equity to expand into B2B offering (Azevedo, 2022). During that same year, the Canadian startup raised CAD $127 million. 


##  ***<font color="red">5. <a name='Recommendationsfont'></a>Recommendations </font>***

###  <font color="blue">_5.1. <a name='IfyouweretoadvisethecompanywhatproductsorserviceswouldyousuggesttheyofferThiscouldbesomethingthatacompetitoroffersoruseyourimaginationfont_'></a>If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)</font>_
As an international student myself, QuadFi's consumer loans were precisely what I needed when I entered Canada. However, options other than local Bank branches are almost invisible. Upon my arrival at Brock University, I was promptly invited to create a Canadian bank account at Scotia Bank (which has a physical branch and multiple ATMS within the campus). Their so-called "student advantage plans" did not meet my criteria. To raise funds, I had to get a loan in my home country and then pay expensive fees to transfer the money to Canada. If I had known about a cheaper and easier solution like QuadFi, I would've chosen it without a doubt. In my opinion, the fintech startup lacks visibility. I only found a handful of articles on this up-and-coming Canadian startup in my research. 
Therefore, <font color="yellow">_I recommend forming partnerships with Canadian universities to boost visibility and increase customer outreach among international students_.</font> In the US, College Ave Student Loans, a leading fintech lending company, has entered this year into a multi-year partnership with the largest track & field meet in the US (Penn Relay Carnival, 2023).
Other than simply using marketing to increase visibility, I suggest partnerships that send _<font color="yellow">email outreach to international students, including resources like a guide to setting up a QuadFi account.</font>_ The email outreach could also include an _<font color="yellow">_attractive loan offer for international students with lower rates</font>_ for the first six months.


###  <font color="blue">_5.2. <a name='Whydoyouthinkthatofferingthisproductorservicewouldbenefitthecompany_font'></a> Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?_</font>

I think that partnering with local universities using email outreach and events sponsoring could greatly benefit QuadFi because, as an online platform, to be visible, they must heavily invest in online marketing, especially to reach younger demographics. QuadFi needs to market itself heavily by putting its logo in student events, generating word-of-mouth advertisements with attractive student offers, and so forth. It's not like a Scotia Bank branch where I only have to walk around campus to recognize the brand, the logo, and its financial services.

###  <font color="blue">_5.3. <a name='Whattechnologieswouldthisadditionalproductorserviceutilize_font'></a>What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?_</font>
I recommend using <font color="yellow">_AI-powered email outreach tools_</font> such as GetREsponse, Delivra, OitboundFlow.ai, Lyne.ai, and SmartWriter to make mass personalized email outreach. 


###  <font color="blue">_5.4. <a name='Whyarethesetechnologiesappropriateforyoursolutionfont'></a> Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?</font>_

Using an AI email outreach tool avoids the labor cost of hiring middlemen who would extract student files and then insert names and addresses into traditional email outreach software like HubSpot. This would enable the company to reinvest these savings into offering student loans at lower interest rates.
